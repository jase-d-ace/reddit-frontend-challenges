# Reddit Front End Challenges

From [this Reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Frontend/comments/1g1gdfy/technical_frontend_interview_assessments_ive_faced/). I found these little code challenges while scrolling on Reddit, so I figured I'd try them myself. They seemed quite doable, and so I built this repo to show how I'd do it.

Challenges are reposted below for clarity:

1. Create a component that displays a recursive nested folder structure, displaying any files in the folder, and any subfolders. When a folder is clicked, display its contents

2. Create a slider component with only javscript. No css or html. Create all elements and attributes with javascript in a single file.

3. Create a pagination component that fetches a list and displays X items at a time. It should have buttons to show the first and last pages, as well as buttons to move to the previous and next page.

4. Create a debounce function on an input field that displays a list of filtered items matching the input, updating on an interval passed into the debounce function.

5. Create a promise that resolves a list of data to simulate an API call, and a component that displays its data.

6. Create an event emitter class that can add an object to a list, retrieve the entire list, and remove items from the list.

7. Create an accordion component in a React class component (not a functional component)

8. Given X api endpoint, retrieve the data, and display a list of the items using an `async await` approach, as well as a `.then()` approach.
