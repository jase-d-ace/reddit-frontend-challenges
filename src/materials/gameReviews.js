      game_title: "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild",
      rating: 7.5,
      content: "While the open-world exploration is impressive, the lack of meaningful progression and the sparse storyline left me feeling like something was missing. The durability of weapons was more frustrating than fun, leading to a somewhat tedious experience over time."

      review_title: "Strong Visuals, Weak Narrative",
      game_title: "God of War",
      rating: 8,
      content: "Though the visuals and combat are spectacular, the narrative falls short of its potential. Kratos' character development feels rushed, and the repetitive boss fights detract from what could have been a groundbreaking game."

      review_title: "Too Much Filler, Not Enough Substance",
      game_title: "Red Dead Redemption 2",
      rating: 7,
      content: "While the world-building and attention to detail are unmatched, the gameplay is bogged down by excessive filler content. The missions quickly become repetitive, and the slow pacing makes it hard to stay engaged throughout the story."

      game_title: "Cyberpunk 2077",
      rating: 6,
      content: "Despite its grand promises, Cyberpunk 2077 failed to deliver on almost every front. The world is visually stunning, but the game is riddled with bugs, broken mechanics, and a hollow storyline. It feels like a missed opportunity more than anything."

      review_title: "Fun at First, but Repetitive",
      game_title: "Hades",
      rating: 8.5,
      content: "Hades offers an exhilarating rogue-like experience initially, but the repetitive nature of the runs and lack of variety in enemies quickly becomes tiresome. While it excels in style, it lacks the depth needed to stay fresh after extended play."
